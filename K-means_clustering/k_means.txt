=> k means

K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm 
that is used to solve the clustering problems in machine learning or data science. 
In this topic, we will learn what is K-means clustering algorithm, how the algorithm works, 
along with the Python implementation of k-means clustering.

The unsupervised k-means algorithm has a loose relationship to the k-nearest neighbor classifier, 
a popular supervised machine learning technique for classification that is often confused with k-means due to the name. 
Applying the 1-nearest neighbor classifier to the cluster centers obtained by k-means classifies new data into the existing clusters. 
This is known as nearest centroid classifier or Rocchio algorithm.

=> How does the K-Means Algorithm Work?

The working of the K-Means algorithm is explained in the below steps:

Step-1: Select the number K to decide the number of clusters.

Step-2: Select random K points or centroids. (It can be other from the input dataset).

Step-3: Assign each data point to their closest centroid, which will form the predefined K clusters.

Step-4: Calculate the variance and place a new centroid of each cluster.

Step-5: Repeat the third steps, which means reassign each datapoint to the new closest centroid of each cluster.

Step-6: If any reassignment occurs, then go to step-4 else go to FINISH.

Step-7: The model is ready.
