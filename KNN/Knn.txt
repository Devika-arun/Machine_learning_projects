**KNN (K-Nearest neighbours)**

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a robust and intuitive 
machine learning method employed to tackle classification and regression problems. 
The K-NN algorithm works by finding the K nearest neighbors to a given data point 
based on a distance metric, such as Euclidean distance. The class or value of the data point 
is then determined by the majority vote or average of the K neighbors. 
This approach allows the algorithm to adapt to different patterns and make predictions 
based on the local structure of the data.

**Euclidean Distance**

Euclidean distance can also be visualized as the length of the straight line 
that joins the two points which are into consideration. This metric helps us calculate 
the net displacement done between the two states of an object.
The formula for Euclidean distance in two dimensions is D = sqrt((X2 - X1)^2 + (Y2 âˆ’ Y1)^2) , 
where D is the Euclidean distance, and ( x 1 , y 1 ) and ( x 2 , y 2 ) are the Cartesian coordinates of the two points.
